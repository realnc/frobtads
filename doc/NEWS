v1.2.4 - 2018-03-13
===================

  - Added a "frobd" binary which is useful for hooking up external
    debuggers. This is frob built against debugger-enabled TADS 3 sources.
    This is not a debugger! It only allows to build debugger front-ends
    around it.

    Disabled by default, unless --enable-frobd is passed to
    ./configure.

    (This change was submitted by "dddddd" on intfiction.org.)

  - Added tadsrsc utility (TADS 2 resource manager.)

  - A couple fixes addressing build failures on modern Clang and GCC
    versions.


v1.2.3 - 2013-05-17
===================

  - Tads virtual machines and compilers updated to 2.5.17/3.1.3


v1.2.2 - 2012/08/29
===================

  - Embedding resource directories with t3make was broken in version 1.2.1
    if the files to be embedded belonged to a different user.  This has been
    fixed.

  - The Tads 3 test suite could not be built in 1.2.1 due to linker errors,
    and in the case of GCC 4.7, also compiler errors.  This should no longer
    occur.

  - The configure script will now automatically append -fno-strict-aliasing
    to the C and C++ compiler options (if the compiler recognizes it).  It's
    not required anymore to do this manually.

  - A POSIX threads underlinking issue has been fixed.


v1.2.1 - 2012/08/22
===================

  - WebUI save/restore functionality was broken in 1.2.  This has been
    fixed.

  - Tads virtual machines and compilers updated to 2.5.15/3.1.2.


v1.2 - 2012/07/16
=================

  - The interpreter should now work correctly when running inside an
    Emacs eterm.

  - The "--no-seed-rand" option should now be usable.

  - 8-bit characters (like German umlauts) should now display correctly.

  - Tads virtual machines and compilers updated to 2.5.15/3.1.1.


v1.1 - 2011/12/29
=================

  - Tads virtual machines and compilers updated to 2.5.15/3.1.0.  Tads
    3.1 introduces network capabilities and currently it is not possible
    to build the package without network support.  pthreads, sockets and
    libcurl are required for a successful build.

  - Compiler and runtime sources have been unified.  It is no longer
    necessary to download separate archives in order to build the T2 or
    T3 compilers.  Because of this, two new configure options have been
    introduced in case you don't want to build the compilers:

      --disable-t2-compiler

    and:

      --disable-t3-compiler


v1.0
====

  - Git is now used for version control.  The repository is hosted at:

      http://www.assembla.com/spaces/frobtads

  - If the terminal size can't be detected, the interpreter will now
    assume 80x24.

  - The --undo-size option was wrongly documented as --t3undo.  This was
    changed in the code a while back, but the --help output stil refered
    to the old name.

  - Games requesting 0ms input-timeouts would result in the input
    operation blocking; this was incorrect behavior and has been fixed.
    0ms requests really mean "don't block and don't wait."

  - The flush() operation was not implemented correctly, which could in
    some cases lead to a game not displaying output.  This would happen
    if the game paused using timing functionality without using any
    input routines to achieve the pause effect.

  - The ChangeLog file has been deprecated and changes will not be
    recorded there any longer, since now we have "git log".

  - A new option has been introduced: -R/--replay which can be used to
    load replay files at startup.  Thanks to Marc Simpson for the patch.


v0.13
=====

  - Tads virtual machines and compilers updated to 2.5.14/3.0.18.1.


v0.12
=====

  - Tads 2 virtual machine and compiler updated to 2.5.11.


v0.11
=====

  - Tads 3 virtual machine and compiler updated to 3.0.16.

  - Embedding resources in Tads 3 game files (like a GameInfo.txt) was
    somewhat broken; the EOF identifier just before the resource wasn't
    removed.  In the case of the GameInfo.txt resource, this resulted
    in third-party tools like Babel and Zoom not being able to read
    this resource.  This has been fixed.  Make sure to recompile your
    games with the now fixed t3make in order to have the resources
    correctly embedded in your game files.


v0.10
=====

  - Since Unicode doesn't work yet correctly in the curses interface,
    the interpreter will use regular ASCII by default to avoid display
    problems with apostrophes and quotes.

  - Compilation problems on Mac OS X 10.5 (Leopard), Intel C++, Solaris
    10 and on the Linux version of the Sun Studio compilers have been
    fixed.

  - FrobTADS should now compile and run correctly as a 64-bit binary,
    at least under x86-64.  Tested under x86-64 Linux, FreeBSD/AMD64 and
    Solaris 10.

  - It should be easier now to cross-compile FrobTADS without modifying
    any code.  If your cross-compiler is called "i586-pc-mingw32-gcc",
    you can cross-compile with:

      ./configure --host=i586-pc-mingw32
      make

    and it should build out-of-the-box.

    If you don't know what cross-compiling is, then you probably don't
    need it ;P

  - The PDCurses library is now correctly detected when building.  It
    will be used if neither ncurses nor curses is found.


v0.9
====

  - Tads 3 virtual machine and compiler updated to 3.0.15.3 (beta).

  - The default project file t3make looks for when invoked without an -f
    argument is now Makefile.t3m instead of makefile.t3m on every
    system.  Capitalizing the first letter of the makefile is common
    practice on Unix.  This means that if you use "Makefile.t3m" as the
    filename for your project file, you only need to type "t3make" with
    no arguments to build your project.

  - You can now choose between screen interfaces by using the new -i (or
    --interface) option.  Available interfaces right now are curses (the
    default if not using the option) and plain (which only does stdio
    input/output).

    This new "plain" interface is still experimental and not complete at
    this point; screen size and text input are not handled correctly.
    Note that even in it's complete implementation, input will be very
    basic in plain mode and none of the more advanced features will ever
    be available (colors, banners, statusline, etc.)  This mode is
    useful for screen readers that might get confused by the more
    complicated output of curses and for using FrobTADS as a back-end
    for other programs (a CGI script to play IF on the web, for
    example).


v0.8
====

  - Tads 3 virtual machine and compiler updated to 3.0.15.1 (beta).


v0.7
====

  - On most POSIX systems, the Tads 3 compiler (t3make) should now be
    able to include resources in the build when -res is used to specify
    a whole directory.  The -recurse option should work also.  (Patch
    was submitted by Ilya V. Goz.)

  - Tads 2 character mapping files are now supported and loaded by the
    interpreter when a game requests them.  Charmap files are
    distributed with some games and the interpreter tries to find them
    in the current directory.  The interpreter changes the current
    directory to the game's directory by default, so if you place the
    mapping files in the game's directory the interpreter should load
    them.  (Patch was submitted by Ilya V. Goz.)

    Note that FrobTADS still has problems with 8-bit character sets,
    since curses deals only with 7-bit characters.  This will hopefully
    be fixed in a feature release.


v0.6
====

  - Tads 3 virtual machine and compiler updated to 3.0.12.


v0.5
====

  - Tads 3 virtual machine and compiler updated to 3.0.11.

  - The compiler was unable to compile sourcefiles that were using a
    non-built-in character set.  For example, a sourcefile beginning
    with #charset "koi8-r" would generate an error message.  This has
    been fixed.

  - The Tads 3 "proto-documentation" has been wiped.  More thourough
    documentation is now available at www.tads.org (it's a 10MB
    download so it has not been included in FrobTADS).


v0.4
====

  - Tads virtual machines and compilers updated to 2.5.10/3.0.10.

  - Fixed a problem where it was not possible to compile TADS 3 games.
    Some required library files, although included in the package, did
    not get installed at the "make install" step.

  - Fixed a compilation problem with "src/missing.cc" ("unknown
    identifier: wc" and "unknown identifier: dst").  This only occured
    on some systems that lack the wchar C99 functions (like some
    Mac OS X systems).

  - Fixed possible color-curruption problems with old/broken curses
    libraries.


v0.3
====

  - Tads virtual machines and compilers updated to 2.5.9/3.0.9 (the
    included Tads 2.5.9 version is more up-to-date than the official
    2.5.9 release, but it's not yet 2.5.10).

  - Statusline now looks good even when colors are disabled
    ("--no-colors" option) or not available.

  - Fixed compilation problem on systems that don't support the SIGWINCH
    signal ("unknown identifier: SIGWINCH"), like MS Windows with MinGW
    and/or Dev-C++.

  - Fixed the fix of the compilation problem with the <wchar.h>
    functions (wcslen and wcscpy); this time for good, I hope.

  - Hopefully improved terminal resize handling.


v0.2
====

Thanks to Mike Roberts, FrobTADS now has its own homepage and main
distribution point:

 http://www.tads.org/frobtads.htm

  - Some command line options have been changed (type "frob --help" to
    list them).

  - Scrollback mode can now also be activated with the Escape (ESC) key.
    Fixed some possible problems with the ENTER key not being recognized
    on some systems.

  - White text on white background ("frob -t7 -b7") should work now.

  - Fixed a curses compilation problem (compilation failed with
    something like: "unknown identifier: KEY_RESIZE").

  - Screen resizing (when running in an xterm) has been improved; a
    signal handler does the job now and some code has been improved for
    better resizing.

  - Fixed a compilation problem on systems that lack the wchar.h header
    and/or the wchar functions wcslen and wcscpy.

  - If you don't override the default colors, or use white on black
    (-b0 -t7), *and* your curses/ncurses version supports it, the
    interpreter will use the default colors of your terminal.  This
    makes it possible to use bitmap pictures as background, or make the
    terminal transparent (if your terminal supports this, of course).
    Note that, by default, this won't work for the statusline, as it
    reverses the colors.  If you want to use this feature for the entire
    screen, you'll have to start frob with "frob -g0 -l7".

    This feature can be disabled using the "-o" (or "--no-defcolors")
    option.

  - The Tads 3 documentation (HTML format) is now installed along with
    the compiler ([prefix]/share/frobtads/tads3/doc).

  - Documentation files have been moved into the new "doc" directory.


v0.1
====

  Initial release.
