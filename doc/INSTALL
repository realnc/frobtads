For impatient people who don't like to read through INSTALL files prior
to installing software on their system:

Enter the directory where you unpacked this package (for example,
"cd ~/downloads/frobtads-1.0").  Type: "./configure" followed by
"make", then "make install".  Play TADS games:
"frob ~/games/tads/arrival.gam".  Get a list of command-line options:
"frob --help".

If you want some more information, read through the rest of this file.

You can find generic and very detailed documentation about the
configuration script in the file CONFIGURE_DOC.


Requirements
============

Libraries
.........

FrobTADS requires a curses compatible library along with its <curses.h>
or <ncurses.h> header file (that means you have to install a curses
development package, not only the runtime package).  ncurses, plain old
curses as well as PDCurses are supported.

If no curses library is found, you can still build and use the
compilers, since only the interpreter needs curses.

In additon, you will need libcurl and its development files installed.
This is needed for some of the network functionality of TADS 3.


Compiler
........

To compile the package you'll need a C and a C++ compiler that support the
C11 and C++14 standards. GCC and Clang are known to work, but others should
work too as long as they support the respective standards.


The quickie
===========

Compile and install:

  ./configure [options]
  make
  make install

You are not required to build in the same directory where you unpacked
the source package.  For example, you can do something like this:

  mkdir ~/build
  cd ~/build
  ../downloads/frobtads-0.10/configure
  make
  make install

Not all versions of Make support this though; check if your version of
Make supports the VPATH feature (GNU Make does, by the way).

Some 'configure' options (cAsE sENsiTiVe):

  --help           Lists every supported option.
  --help=short     Lists only FrobTADS specific options.
  --prefix=PATH    Top-level installation directory.  Default is
                    "/usr/local".
  --bindir=PATH    Exact installion point of the binaries.  Default is
                    "PREFIX/bin".
  --datadir=PATH   Installation directory for the various data-files.
                    Default is "PREFIX/share".  Note that a subdirectory
                    called "frobtads" will be created automaticly.
  --enable-t3debug Will build the debug version of the T3VM.  This
                    results in slower code, but is useful for people who
                    want to make changes to the source code.  This will
                    also enable the TADS 3 test suite.
  --disable-t2-compiler
  --disable-t3-compiler These options disable the building of the TADS 2
                    and TADS 3 compiler respectively.

If you don't intent to hack around in the interpreter's source code, you
can also specify this option:

  --disable-dependency-tracking

This will result in a faster compile.  But if you make changes to the
source code, a "make" won't be able to always tell which source files
changed.

You may specify your own C and C++ compiler flags like so:

  ./configure CFLAGS="-O3 -pipe -march=pentium4" CXXFLAGS="-O3 -pipe -march=pentium4"

If you used the "--enable-t3debug" configure option, you can run the test
suite with:

  make check

You are *not* required to do a "make install" prior to running the test
suite.

Play Tads games:

  frob [sometadsgame]

The file extension (.gam or .t3) is optional.



Detailed instructions
=====================

To install FrobTADS, you'll have to compile it first, and to compile it
you'll have to configure it.  The procedure is very easy and is
described in detail below.


Configuration
.............

First, the package has to find out some information about your system.
Then, a "makefile" has to be created, since the "make" utility is used
for building FrobTADS.  Both steps are accomplished by entering the
following command:

  ./configure

If you want to build the debug version of TADS 3:

  ./configure --enable-t3debug

This will result in slower code (as it performs additional checks in
this mode) and is not recommended for production builds.  This will also
enable the TADS 3 test suite (see below).

You can specify where FrobTADS will be installed by passing arguments to
'configure'.  For example, if you want the executable(s) to be installed
in "/usr/bin" and the data-files in "/usr/share", you can call
'configure' like this:

  ./configure --prefix=/usr

If you don't specify a prefix-directory, "/usr/local" will be used.

You can fine-tune the installation points of the various files.  For
example, if you want the executable(s) to be installed in "/usr/bin",
but the various data-files in "/opt", you can do:

  ./configure --bindir=/usr/bin --datadir=/opt

Note that a subdirectory called "frobtads" will be created automaticly,
so don't use "--datadir=/opt/frobtads"; just "--datadir=/opt".

You can also pass compiler-flags to 'configure', and they will be passed
on to the compiler.  For example, to compile the C sources with "-O3" and
the C++ sources with "-O2 -fno-exceptions", call 'configure' like this:

  ./configure CFLAGS="-O3" CXXFLAGS="-O2 -fno-exceptions"

(Don't forget to quote the options if they contain spaces, like in the
above example.)

Even if the shell allows it, please don't use this:

  CFLAGS="-O3" ./configure

*Always* specify these variables *after* the "./configure" part.

If you're using GCC, you should add -fno-exceptions to the C++ options,
since FrobTADS doesn't make use of C++ exceptions.  You'll save some RAM
and get a smaller executable, which is a Good Thing on low-end systems.
You may want to check out the GCC docs to see what optimization options
are available; typing "info gcc" on the console should get you started.

With GCC, if you want FrobTADS to be compiled with optimized code that
is tailored to your system's CPU, use the "-march=CPU" option.  Recent
GCC versions allow you to use "-march=native", in which case the
compiler will detect your CPU and optimize the code accordingly.  For
GCC versions that do not support "native", you have to specify your CPU
by name.  A few examples for the CPU value on PCs:

  i386, i486, pentium, pentium-mmx, pentiumpro, pentium2, pentium3,
  pentium4, prescott, nocona (that's the 64bit P4; what, you have one?)
  core2, athlon, athlon-4, athlon-xp, athlon64

For example: "-march=pentium4" of you have a Pentium4 or Celeron D.

Note that older GCC versions don't support all of the above.  For the
full list of CPUs, type:

  info gcc invoking submodel

To find out the GCC version you have, type

  gcc --version


Compilation
...........

Now that the makefile has been created, you can compile the package with
the following command:

  make

The compilation should finish without errors (although there might be
warning messages; you can usually ignore them).  If compilation aborts
with an error-message, send a bug report to the maintainer (include the
error-message, the name and version of your compiler, and details about
your system).

If you've built the debug version of TADS 3, you can run the test suite
by typing:

  make check

This will build the test programs and then run some test scripts.  If
not all of the tests succeed, there's something wrong.  Contact the
maintainer in this case.

You don't need to install the package prior to running the test suite.

Since running the test suite requires you to build the debug version of
the T3VM, you should do a

  make clean

to delete the debug version and then configure and compile the package
again without the "--enable-t3debug" option.  Installing and using the
debug version for regular work is not recommended.

If you want to do a sanity-check on the TADS 3 compiler, you can type:

  make sample

This will compile the TADS 3 library sample game.  It will be placed in
the "samples" subdirectory of the build directory.  You can run it with:

  ./frob ./samples/sample.t3

"make sample" does not require the debug-version of T3, so it's always a
good idea to try it out before installing the package.


Installation
............

To install the package, type:

  make install

You'll probably have to login as root first, if you're installing in a
directory where you don't have write-access.  If you're installing
everything in your own home-directory, you don't have to be root.  On
most systems, you can use the "sudo" command to execute the above as
root:

  sudo make install

You will be prompted to enter root's password (or your own if you're on
Ubuntu).

This will install FrobTADS on your system and you're ready to play all
those Tads games.  The TADS compilers will be installed too, along with
their data files and development libraries, as long as you didn't disable
them during the ./configure step.

If the above procedure doesn't work for you, contact the maintainer.
See the README file for an email address.  Or type:

  ./configure --help

This will print the maintainer's email address as the last line.


Usage
.....

To play a Tads game, just pass the game's filename as an argument to
'frob', like this:

  frob /usr/local/games/tads/zebulon.gam

The extension ".gam" (or ".t3" for Tads 3 games) is optional.  Typing:

  frob --help

will list the supported command-line options.

If you also installed the compilers, look at their documentation on how
to use them.  For starters, take a look at the COMPILERS file.



Operating systems
=================


Mac OS X
........

OS X should work just like "regular" Unix.  Nothing special is required
to build the interpreter on OS X, and therefore the above instructions
also apply for OS X.  Don't forget to install the OS X curses/ncurses
and libcurl development packages first.


Microsoft Windows
.................

** The below is outdated; it is currently NOT possible to build FrobTADS
** on Windows with MinGW/MSYS.  The last known version to build on
** Windows is 1.0.  It might be possible to build using Cygwin.

Yes, you can compile FrobTADS even in Windows.  If you're using
MinGW/MSYS or cygwin, just configure and compile like in Unix.  Of
course, you must have a curses or ncurses library installed in a place
where the compiler and linker can find it (PDCurses is known to work).

Note that the TADS 3 test suite won't work in Windows, because of the
difference in text line terminators.

You can also cross-compile from Unix to Windows.  If your
cross-compiler is, for example "i586-pc-mingw32-gcc", configure with:

  ./configure --host=i586-pc-mingw32

and after "make" you should have your Windows *.exe files.  This is in
fact supported, tested and known to work.
